## Getting Better Data (Recommended Before Draft)

### 1 — Add 2026 Steamer Projections (biggest upgrade)

Download free CSVs from FanGraphs and drop them in `seasons/2026/projections/`:

| File | URL |
|---|---|
| `steamer_batters.csv` | fangraphs.com → Projections → Steamer → Batters → Export |
| `steamer_pitchers.csv` | fangraphs.com → Projections → Steamer → Pitchers → Export |

Then re-run `python3 analysis/player_rankings.py`.

### 2 — Pull ESPN Historical Data (biggest analytical upgrade)

Fetches weekly matchup W/L by category, rosters, and draft history for all available seasons.
This unlocks direct H2H category correlation instead of relying on season totals.

**Get your ESPN cookies:**
1. Log in at espn.com in Chrome/Safari
2. Open DevTools → Application → Cookies → espn.com
3. Copy `espn_s2` and `SWID`

```bash
export ESPN_S2="AExxxxxxxxx..."
export ESPN_SWID="{XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX}"

python3 scripts/fetch_espn_history.py          # pulls all available years
python3 analysis/category_weights.py           # re-derives weights (now H2H-based)
python3 analysis/player_rankings.py            # re-ranks players
```

## Category Weights (H2H matchup-derived)

Derived via Spearman correlation between per-category win% and overall matchup win%, across 60 team-seasons (2019–2025, excluding 2020).

| Category | Weight | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| TB | 11.4% | Most predictive |
| HR | 10.8% | |
| R | 10.0% | |
| RBI | 9.9% | |
| H | 8.3% | |
| W | 7.2% | |
| K | 7.0% | |
| WHIP | 6.2% | Lower = better |
| QS | 6.0% | |
| ERA | 5.7% | Lower = better |
| SB | 4.6% | |
| BB | 3.5% | |
| AVG | 3.4% | |
| L | 3.3% | Lower = better |
| HD | 2.5% | 2020+ only |
| SV | 0.2% | Weakest predictor — do not reach for closers |

## Data Notes

- `seasons/2019/standings.csv` — AVG column is corrupted in source (shows ~6.3 instead of ~0.263); excluded from AVG correlation
- ESPN API history is available from 2019 onwards; 2016–2018 standings are from the manually maintained Excel file
- CG (Complete Games) was a scoring category in 2016–2019, replaced by HD in 2020
